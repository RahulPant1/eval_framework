Instead of relying solely on the knowledge embedded during the model's training, RAG retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating a response, leading to more accurate and informative outputs.

Additionally, RAG-specific metrics like faithfulness and relevance are used.</td>
                        <td>Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include:

* **Retrieval-focused metrics:** precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR), assessing the relevance of retrieved documents.
* **Generation-focused metrics:** BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, evaluating the quality of the generated text compared to reference answers.
* **RAG-specific metrics:** faithfulness and relevance, measuring how well the generated response uses retrieved information and addresses the original query.
