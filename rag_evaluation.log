Text: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources.

Text: Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector.

Text: Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query.

Answer: RAG systems are evaluated using retrieval-focused metrics (e.g., precision, recall, MRR) and generation-focused metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR), as well as RAG-specific metrics like faithfulness and relevance.

Question:  How do retrieval-focused metrics differ from generation-focused metrics in evaluating RAG systems?
Answer: Retrieval-focused metrics assess the quality of the retrieved documents (e.g., how relevant they are), while generation-focused metrics evaluate the quality of the generated text itself by comparing it to reference answers.

2025-04-08 20:18:02,585 - INFO - Prompt sent to Gemini model: Answer the following question based on the context: Question: What types of metrics are used to evaluate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems?

Context: Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources. Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector.

2025-04-08 20:24:13,951 - INFO - Prompt sent to Gemini model: Answer the following question based on the context: Question: What types of metrics are used to evaluate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and what aspects of the system do they assess?

Context: Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources. Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector.
