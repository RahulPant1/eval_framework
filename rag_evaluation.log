Text: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources.

Text: Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector.

Text: Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query.

2025-04-07 15:48:31,842 - INFO - Prompt sent to Gemini model: Answer the following question based on the context: Question: What is the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach in natural language processing?

Context: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources. Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query. Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector.

These embeddings represent semantic information about text, images, or other data types in a numerical format that captures their meaning and relationships. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. They typically support similarity search operations like k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find the most similar vectors to a query vector. Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include both retrieval-focused metrics and generation-focused metrics. Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) assess how well the system retrieves relevant documents. Generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference answers. Additionally, RAG-specific metrics such as faithfulness and relevance help measure how well the generated response uses the retrieved information and addresses the original query. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods for natural language processing tasks. In RAG, a retrieval component first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses. This approach helps address the limitations of large language models by grounding their generations in external, up-to-date knowledge sources.
